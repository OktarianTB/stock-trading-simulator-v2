# Stock Trading Simulator v2

Two years ago I built a [Stock Trading Simulator](https://github.com/OktarianTB/stock-trading-simulator) using the MERN stack which went on to be one of my most successful personal projects.

Now, I have built upon that original project to create version 2! For this update, I completely scrapped the old backend and rewrote everything in Golang. I kept most of the frontend but refactored much of the Material UI code that had been deprecated.

It was fun to revisit this project and add some new improvements, including an updated authentication system, stronger data integrity, and CI/CD pipeline.
